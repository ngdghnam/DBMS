# Database Management System

## A case study

In the process of using and analyzing data from the Invoelines table of the Worldwideimporters Database, we realize that this table plays an important role in the synthesis of revenue and monthly profits. This is a popular requirement in businesses, helping to support the preparation of financial statements and business decisions. However, as the data increases, the query process becomes slow, affecting the system performance. Therefore, we decide to optimize performance for these queries to improve processing speed.
